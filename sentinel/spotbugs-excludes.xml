	<!-- Unit tests were written to store a local file report showing the
	results of using LabBot to login a list of users.  This file does not
	appear to be used for anything but perhaps visual assessment by a
	developer but for consistency the rule exposes support for this report
	file to unit tests via an annotation to be specified to write the report
	file.  By default, the filename is local to the running directory named
	users.txt.  The annotation allows this default name to be overridden.
	Annotations do not allow File values to be specified via parameter so
	the filename must be a string.  If report is enabled, this value of the
	string is used to create a file by this name.  This rule is not anticipated
	to be exposed within application code so therefore, this should is
	considered a false positive. -->
